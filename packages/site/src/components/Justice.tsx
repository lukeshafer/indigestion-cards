			<h1>#justiceForSocks</h1>
			<p>
				Recently, our streamer, Ryan, has decided to punish those who demand justice. When
				opening someone's pack, if he sees the text "#justiceForSocks" in their page bio,{' '}
				<strong>he will move the pack down the list and opens someone else's</strong>. All
				because they ask for justice?
			</p>

			<p>
				For the unaware, in Ryan's playthrough of{' '}
				<i>The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild</i>, he had a lovely horse named
				Socks. Socks was a good horse and did nothing wrong. I'll put the full details below
				for risk of spoiling the playthrough, but in short,{' '}
				<strong>Ryan made Socks stand in the cold, alone, for a LONG time</strong>.
			</p>

					of the Wild playthrough and a few game details (no story spoilers).

				<div class="m-8">
					<p>
						In episode 80, Ryan searches for a Stalhorse, an undead skeletal horse
						ridden by Stalkoblins, a different skeletal monster of the Zelda world. In a
						fight against the Stalkoblins in the Hebra region, Ryan is knocked off Socks
						by an attack. He does not get on Socks again that episode, leaving the poor
						horse out in the cold, snowy region of Hebra, in favor of a Stalhorse (to be
						clear, I mean no disrespect to the Stalhorse, which is a misunderstood
						creature in itself, and to which Ryan DID show respect).
					</p>

					<p>
						Notably, for those unfamiliar, being in this area requires Link to wear warm
						clothes or consume a food item or potion to grant cold resistance -
						something horse's are not able to do in this game. Ryan found Socks as a
						wild horse in the Necluda region near the Ash Swamp -- an area with a much
						different climate to the Hebra region, meaning the poor horse is not even
						acclimated to the cold temperature.
					</p>

					<p>
						From that point, Ryan does not ride Socks again until{' '}
						<strong>episode 130</strong> of the playthrough. Not only does he not ride
						Socks, but he intentionally leaves Socks in the cold when he could summon
						the horse to a stable, for free, with minimal effort. In fact,{' '}
						<strong>Ryan only saves Socks by accident</strong> when trying to register
						another horse.
					</p>

					<div class="ml-4">
						<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIgMlTd0tuY&t=1608s">
							<p>Ah crap.</p>

						<cite>
							Ryan{' '}
							<a

								target="_blank">
								upon hearing that Socks will be taken into the stable's care.
							</a>
						</cite>
					</div>

					<p>
						To be more precise, after abandoning Socks in the cold, Ryan played the game
						for <strong>47 hours, 5 minutes, and 8 seconds</strong> (at least based on
						episode times). Though this doesn't account for things like pausing the
						game, loading times, and fast-forwarding time via resting, this number
						translates to roughly 588 in-game days (one day in-game = 288 real-life
						seconds). Even if we only use half that number to account for the various
						things that can freeze time, this means Socks was left in that spot for
						MONTHS, all alone, surrounded by monsters, waiting for Ryan to return.
					</p>

			<p>
				If you too are appalled by Ryan's mistreatment of Socks, you can show your support
				for the sweet horse by updating your "looking for" message or pinned card message to
				include the text "#justiceForSocks". If your profile includes that text and you have
				a pack, your name will have a lovely horse icon on Ryan's pack list, making your
				support loud and clear until Ryan provides the justice we seek.
