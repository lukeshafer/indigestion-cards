Recently, our streamer Ryan has decided to punish those who demand justice. If he's about to open someone's pack and sees the text "#justiceforsocks" in their page bio, <strong>Moves the pack down the list and opens someone else's</strong>. All because they ask for justice?
</p>

<p>
For the unaware, in Ryan's playthrough of <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild</i>, he had a lovely horse named Socks. Socks was a good horse and did nothing wrong. I'll put the full details below for risk of spoiling the playthrough, but in short, <strong>Ryan made Socks stand in the cold, alone, for a LONG time</strong>.

In episode 80, Ryan searches for a Stalhorse, an undead skeletal horse ridden by Stalkoblins, a different skeletal monster of the Zelda world. In a fight against the Stalkoblins in the Hebra region, Ryan is knocked off Socks by a bomb. He does not get on Socks again that episode, leaving the poor horse out in the cold, snowy region of Hebra. Notably, for those unfamiliar, being in this area requires Link to wear warm clothes or consume a food item or potion to grant cold resistance - something horse's are not able to do in this game. Ryan found Socks as a wild horse in the Necluda region near the Ash Swamp -- an area with a much different climate to the Hebra region, meaning the poor horse is not even acclimated to the cold temperature.

<p>
From that point, Ryan does not ride Socks again until <strong>episode 130</strong> of the playthrough. Not only does he not ride Socks, but he intentionally leaves Socks in the cold when he could summon the horse to a stable, for free, with minimal effort. In fact, <strong>Ryan only saves Socks by accident</strong> when trying to register another horse. Here's a quote from Ryan</p>

    <p>Ah crap.</p>

</div>

<p>To be more precise, after abandoning Socks in the cold, Ryan played the game for <strong>47 hours, 5 minutes, and 8 seconds</strong> (at least based on episode times). Though this doesn't account for things like pausing the game, loading times, and fast-forwarding time via resting, this number translates to roughly 588 in-game days (as one day in-game is 288 real-life seconds). Even if we only use half that number to account for the various things that can freeze time, this means Socks was left in that spot for MONTHS, all alone, surrounded by monsters, waiting for Ryan to return.

If you too are appalled by Ryan's mistreatment of Socks, you can show your support of the sweet horse by updating your "looking for" message or pinned card message to include the text "#justiceforsocks". If your profile includes that text and you have a pack, your name will have a lovely horse icon on Ryan's pack list, making your support loud and clear until Ryan provides the justice we seek.
