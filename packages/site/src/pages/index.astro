			<SubHeading>What are indigestion cards?</SubHeading>
			<p>
				These cards are a way for Ryan (and several other people involved) to say thank you
				to the tightest community on the internet for their generosity and loyalty. The
				cards feature incredible art from artists you know that celebrate the lore of
				streams and videos from the last 4 years :) Collect the ones that mean the most to
				you or chase the ultra-rare full art cards, whatever you desire!
			</p>

			<SubHeading>How do I get indigestion cards?</SubHeading>
			<p>
				You can get a pack (of 5 cards) in two ways: 1) by gifting any quantity of 5 subs at
				once (5 gifted subs = 1 pack, 10 = 2 packs, etc) or 2) by redeeming 100k channel
				points
			</p>

			<SubHeading>How do I open my pack of cards?</SubHeading>
			<p>
				Ryan opens the packs on stream, so we can all be jealous when you pull that
				incredible pink 1/1 card :) he will probably open packs at the start of stream once
				a week! Stay tuned to discord for details.
			</p>

		<section>
			<SubHeading>How can I see what cards I have?</SubHeading>
			<p>
				By clicking on “users” at indigestioncards.com, you can see all the cards that you
				(or anyone else) own!
			</p>

			<SubHeading>
				What do the colored frames around my cards mean? And the numbers in the bottom
				right?
			</SubHeading>
			<p>
				The colors represent the “rarity” of the card--AKA how many of that specific color
				of that card exist! If you have a brown lilindMEG with a 3/50 on the bottom right,
				that means you own 1 the 3rd of the 50 brown lilindMEG’s that exist. If you have a
				1/1 pink lilindMEG, you have <strong>
					the only pink lilindMEG that will ever exist
				</strong>. Have a card without a frame? That’s an ultra-rare Full Art card!

		<section>
			<SubHeading>Can I trade my cards with others?</SubHeading>
			<p>
				Not yet :) but if this first season of cards is well-received, we would LOVE to work
				on giving you the ability to do just that, and more!
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<SubHeading>When will you introduce [insert feature here]???</SubHeading>
			<p>
				We LOVE the idea of more features on the website or new ways to interact with the
				cards–but that might take some time :)
			</p>

		<section>
			<SubHeading>I have an idea for a future card!</SubHeading>
			<p>Great! Go to the #indigestion-cards channel in discord and tell us your idea :)</p>

		<section>
			<SubHeading>
				What do I do if [insert problem here]? (my cards aren’t showing up in my inventory/I
				think I should have a pack but I don’t/I encountered a problem with the website)
			</SubHeading>
			<p>
				If you encounter a problem, you can either DM Ryan on discord or post in the
				#indigestion-cards channel on discord with a description of what’s happening!
